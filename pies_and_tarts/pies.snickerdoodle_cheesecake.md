# Snickerdoodle Cheesecake
## Ingredients
- 2 cups cinnamon graham cracker crumbs (about 14 whole crackers)
- 1/2 cup butter, melted

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 325Â°. Place a greased 9-in. springform pan on a double thickness of heavy-duty foil (about 18 in. square). Wrap foil securely around pan.
2. Mix cracker crumbs and melted butter. Press onto bottom and 1-1/2 in. up sides of prepared pan.
3. Beat cream cheese and 3/4 cup sugar until smooth. Beat in cinnamon and vanilla. Add eggs; beat on low speed just until blended. Fold in baking chips. Pour into crust. Place springform pan in a larger baking pan; add 1 in. of hot water to larger pan.
