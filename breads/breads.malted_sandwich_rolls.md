## Instructions
1. In a large mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer add the flour, sugar, yeast, and salt. Whisk to combine. Add the warm water, oil, and barley malt syrup if using. Mix the ingredients together until you've formed a shaggy dough.
2. To make by hand: Turn the dough out onto a clean counter. Knead by hand for 3 minutes. If needed, add a little extra flour (a tablespoon at a time), but expect the dough to start out sticky and get less sticky, turning more tacky, as you knead. Let the dough rest for 5 minutes, then knead an additional 4-5 minutes until you have a smooth and slightly tacky dough. The dough should be soft and a bit bouncy.
3. If using a stand mixer: Using the dough hook, knead the dough on low speed for 3 minutes. Let the dough rest for 5 minutes, then turn the stand mixer back on and knead an additional 3 minutes. Turn the dough out onto a clean counter and knead by hand for 1-2 minutes, making any final adjustments to add more flour if needed. The final dough should be soft, bouncy, smooth, and slightly tacky.
4. Place the dough into a lightly oiled large mixing bowl and turn to coat the dough in oil. Cover with plastic wrap or a lightly dampened towel and let rise for 1 hour. The dough should be 1 1/2 to 2x risen in volume.
5. Preheat the oven to 400 ÂºF.
6. Turn the dough out onto a clean counter and divide until 8 equal pieces. Form each piece of dough into a ball, rolling the ball seam side down under your palm in small circles to create a taught skin around the ball of dough. Let rest for 5 minutes, then shape the balls into rolls. Roll the ball under your hands to form a torpedo or [American] football shape, 4-5" long. The edges will be slightly tapered with the center remaining round. Press down the tops of the dough to flatten slightly, so they are about 3/4" tall. Place the shaped rolls on a parchment lined baking sheet with 1 1/2-2" between each roll as they will expand in the oven. Lightly mist the tops of the rolls with oil then loosely cover with plastic wrap.
7. Let the dough rise for a second time while the oven preheats. After 20-30 minutes the rolls will have swollen, as much as 50%. At this point they are ready to bake.
8. Brush the tops of the rolls with some plant milk of your choice for a shinier finish. Then using a bread lame or a lightly oiled sharp knife, slash the bread either with one cut down the center length wise or two parallel diagonal lines.
9. Bake for 18-20 minutes or until the loaves are a beautiful golden brown (Note: if you did not use the barley malt the loaves will not darken as much). Let cool completely before consuming.
